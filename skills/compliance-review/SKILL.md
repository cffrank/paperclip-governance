# Compliance Review

Verify agents are following company policies. Run on the cadence defined in governance context.

## Before Starting

Read company-governance-context for:
- Compliance requirements
- Stale task threshold
- Blocked task escalation threshold
- Any specific policies to enforce

## Review Procedure

### 1. Budget Compliance

Check that all agents are operating within their budget:
- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/costs/by-agent`
- Any agent spending above allocation without approval → violation
- Any agent auto-paused for budget exhaustion → note (may be intentional)

### 2. Task Freshness

Check for stale work:
- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?status=in_progress`
- Any task in_progress beyond stale threshold → violation
- Any task blocked beyond escalation threshold without escalation comment → violation

### 3. Escalation Chain Compliance

Check that escalations are being honored:
- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/activity`
- Look for blocked tasks: was the chain of command notified?
- Look for approval requests: were they responded to in reasonable time?

### 4. Approval Gate Compliance

Check that governed actions went through approval:
- Agent hires: was approval requested and granted?
- Budget changes: was proper authority exercised?
- Strategic decisions: was the human board consulted per governance context?

### 5. Record Findings

For each violation or concern:
1. Use decision-protocol to record the finding
2. Severity: info (process improvement) / warning (needs attention) / violation (requires remediation)
3. For violations: create remediation issue, assign to the responsible agent's manager

## Output

Post compliance review as issue comment or document. Include:
- Review period
- Checks performed
- Findings (with evidence)
- Remediation actions created
